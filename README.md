This is Bryce Watson's portfolio, currently a work in progress.

# Architecture

The site is based on Next.js v10 & Material UI React. It is deployed to the Vercel cloud as its backend. It's running a custom internationalization package that uses Next dyamic routing to reload pages based on language preferences. Nivo is also used for data visualization.
